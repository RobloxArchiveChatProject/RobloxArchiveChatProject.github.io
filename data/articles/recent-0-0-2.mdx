Recently, I added some new updates to make this web app much more accessible.
One of them was the hugest update leading to the great **0.0.2 Version**!

## Update I: The Chat Color Indicator

This update essentially migrated Roblox's formula to calculate
the player's chat color.

## Update II: Data Structure

Besides the plain filelist, the second update made it drastically easier for users
to navigate through tons of information and find the correct chat logs.
For example, the _"Search with Names/IDs"_ and _"Search with Game ID"_
utilized the power of taxonomy.

## Update III: UI Overhaul

This update would be apparent. I guess.
